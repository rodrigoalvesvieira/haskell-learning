# Haskell Learning

A set of Haskell programs I'm writing in order to learn this amazing language and master Functional Programming

## Tracking the Learning

| Week         | Begin            | End              |
| -------------|:----------------:|-----------------:|
| 1            | March 16, 2015   | March 22, 2015   |
| 2            | March 23, 2015   | March 30, 2015   |

## Priorities

The goal of this project is also of leveraging all Functional Programming techniques and concepts whenever possible and in the best way possible. So keep in mind:

* Immutability
* Pure Functions
* Lazy Evaluation

## Usage

Either run the file directly from the command line, like:

`$ ghci Lista_1-2012_1.hs`

Or enter `ghci` and do:

```haskell
:l Lista_1-2012_1
```
